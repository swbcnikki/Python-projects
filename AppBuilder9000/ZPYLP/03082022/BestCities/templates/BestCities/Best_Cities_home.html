    <h3>Charleston, SC</h3>
        <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2021%2F08%2F12%2Fcharleston-south-carolina-01-USCITIESWB21.jpg" width="700">
            <p class="paragraph-justify">Charleston, the South Carolina port city founded in 1670,
    is defined by its cobblestone streets, horse-drawn carriages and pastel antebellum houses,
    particularly in the elegant French Quarter and Battery districts.
    The Battery promenade and Waterfront Park both overlook Charleston Harbor, while Fort Sumter,
    a federal stronghold where the first shots of the Civil War rang out, lies across the water.</p>

    <h3>Santa Fe, AZ</h3>
        <img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2021%2F08%2F12%2Fsanta-fe-new-mexico-02-USCITIESWB21.jpg" width="700">
            <p class="paragraph-justify">Santa Fe, New Mexico’s capital, sits in the Sangre de Cristo foothills.
    It’s renowned for its Pueblo-style architecture and as a creative arts hotbed.
    Founded as a Spanish colony in 1610, it has at its heart the traditional Plaza.
    The surrounding historic district’s crooked streets wind past adobe landmarks including the Palace of the Governors,
    now home to the New Mexico History Museum.</p>
