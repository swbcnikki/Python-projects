# 1. Create your models here.
    # 0 prior to this, set up the settings.py, Masonry_base.html, musicfiles_home.html, some css, urls, views.
    # Models.py is How data is represented, accessed, manipulated. defined/represented by Python classes, automated by Django.
    # the class is called model. it drives the dB data.
    # this should be in the app directory folder, RevitFunctions is an app (there can be more than 1 app)
    # each app should have it's own __init__.py, manage.py, settings.py, urls.py
    # go back to the directory where manage.py resides > type: python manage.py makemigrations >
    # then migrate
    # since created classes for forms, next to create the forms.py
    # models.py: Here you can store the applicationâ€™s data models.
#This is where you specify the entities and relationships between data.
    #dB schema
#https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/models/
# next 1A. register the application in admin.py
# need to migrate after any changes to dB.

# Create your models here = Create all Classes here
# Story2, Step1: Create your model and add a migration, make sure to plan out all the categories you want to track for your object. Include an objects manager for accessing the database.
